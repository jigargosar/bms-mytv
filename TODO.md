# TODO

[x] publish on github
[x] deploy on firebase
[x] show request inflight placeholders
[x] * lazy load images
* Clean up UI
    [x] header
    * video close btn
    * video summary pane
                    
* Setup CI
* defer loading media player. it's delaying time to render.
* Retry on Http & Image loading errors, i.e. on network issues.

# Skipping:

* Figure out how UI should look, on mobile/small screen.
    * it will take more time.
    * and mock video didn't include it.
    * But on small screen we should replace image thumb with video itself.
